<p><span class="lex">LEXICON </span>is a user friendly online language dictionary for the masses which aims to keep records of words,their respective meaning and corresponding language.It is multilingual owning to the fact that anyone can input or search for words other than English.
Searching for the meaning of a words cannot get more easy than this.A user can search the word or language which will return him the desired result provided the word meaning is already in the database.If the searched word is not present in the database the user can input the words along with the meaning and language.
this functionality makes LEXICON far more user friendly and efficient than other dictionaries of the same kind.
<br/><br/>This project is spearheaded by the 6th semester students of JORHAT ENGINEERING COLLEGE :</p>
